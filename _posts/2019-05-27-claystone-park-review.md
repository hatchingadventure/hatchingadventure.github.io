# A wonderful hidden gem of a park. 

Overall raking: 4/5 

Dates: 23-28 May 2019

We spent 5 really fun days at Claystone in Macon, GA in site 16. The campground is rather small, but it’s part of a much larger recreation area. Its managed by the [Macon-Bibb County government]( http://laketobo.maconbibb.us/camping/ "Lake Tobo Website"). and is very much above average compared to other city parks we've stayed at.


## Site 16

_Jackson made sure that site 16's gravel was mowed to perfection_

Hookups: Water / electric / cable

Site 16 was very conveniently located next to the shower house. The equipment (grill & picnic table) appeared to be fairly new. The site was a little unlevelled and required the tongue jack to be fully extended to get close to level. 

__Note on shower house:__ It’s built like a concrete bunker. In fact a group of campers survived a direct hit from a tornado in 2005 inside one of the shower houses at Lake Tobesofkee. 


## Park amenities

_lots of children were at the beach_

 The main attraction of the park was the lake beach. It was rather large and not too crowed even on a popular weekend like Memoral Day. There were life guards on site and the park even has dedicated law enforcement park rangers that patroled reguarly. 
 
 Other amenities included;
  - lots of day use picnic areas (w/ grills) 
  - Boat ramp with plenty of parking
  - Commercial marina (next door) with boat rentals 
  - Group pavilions 
  - Frisbee golf course
  - Paved and dirt tails for biking and walking
  - Dump station

_Not the white sands and clear water of the gulf, but the sand was clean and plenty fun to play with!_

_Jack wasn't sure about the toads. There were a lot of them in our campsite at night._
