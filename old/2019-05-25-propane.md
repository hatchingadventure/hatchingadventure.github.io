Work in progress... 

Dealing with propane can be a new experence with many getting started in RVing. Its also one of the most dangerious aspects. 


# A quick primer

1. Propane is dangerous. Mishanlded or broken equipment can result in major loss or death. 

2. Propane tanks expire. Every tank should have a date stampe on it. If you tank is expired stop using it immediately. Responsable vendors won't refill it anyways. 

3. Tanks should never be filled to "capaciy". A 20lb tank will never actually have 20lbs in it. 

4. Refiling is way cheaper than exchanging. Thats what we will be talking about today. 



# Why pay more than double?
